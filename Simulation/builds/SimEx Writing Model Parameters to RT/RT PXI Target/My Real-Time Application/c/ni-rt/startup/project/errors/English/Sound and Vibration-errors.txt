<nierror code="1974">
Sound & Vibration:  This VI coerced <b>number of lines</b> to provide sufficient resolution for the zoom.
</nierror>
<nierror code="1977">
Sound & Vibration:  VI was automatically restarted, because the channel name changed. Please make sure that you are not indexing an array of channels into a loop to perform an averaged operation.

<nierror code="1980">
Sound & Vibration:  Peak search results might be inaccurate because the spectrum was integrated or weighted in the frequency domain.
</nierror>
<nierror code="1981">
Sound & Vibration:  VI automatically was reset because <b>frequency spacing</b> changed.

Sound & Vibration:  Big Brother is watching.
</nierror>
<nierror code="1990">
Sound & Vibration:  No scaling was applied to the data, because previous scaling was detected. This VI is not intended to be used as a units conversion VI.
</nierror>
<nierror code="1992">
Sound & Vibration:  The existing dB reference in the waveform attributes was overwritten with the specified <b>dB reference</b>.
</nierror>
<nierror code="1997">
Sound & Vibration:  The waterfall buffer was automatically reset, because z0, dz, or dx changed from the previously buffered data.
</nierror>
<nierror code="4951">
Sound & Vibration:  Input <b>spectra</b> were converted to linear scale before being written to file in order to conform with the UFF58b standard.

<nierror code="4952">
Sound & Vibration:  The UFF File has been modified by another process or application.

<nierror code="4968">
Sound & Vibration:  Text field exceeds the maximum character limit.
</nierror>
<nierror code="4969">
Sound & Vibration:  When run continuously, only the last data passed through the step is written to file. This step does not buffer the data.
